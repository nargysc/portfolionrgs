I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems from Beykent University in Istanbul in 2019 and completed my master's in Entrepreneurship and Management at Riga Technical University in January 2024. During my academic journey, I had an internship in front-end development at Accenture Baltics in 2022, although I had to discontinue it due to the demands of my master's studies. After graduating with my master's in Riga, I have decided to fully dedicate myself to my front-end engineering journey.Currently, I am deeply immersed in Front-End Development, learning on my own, fueled by my passion for creating digital experiences that are both immersive and visually captivating, leaving a lasting impact on users even after they have interacted with them. In my free time, I play tennis ðŸŽ¾ (that's why the cursor here is a tennis ball), visit new speciality coffee places, and explore nature outside the city.",
